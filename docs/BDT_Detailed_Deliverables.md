# BDT Framework: Detailed Deliverables and Implementation Order

## Executive Summary

The BDT (Build-Deploy-Test) Framework focuses on **operational excellence** rather than code development. Unlike the previous development phases where we created the ALL-USE platform code, BDT is about creating **automation scripts**, **deployment procedures**, **testing frameworks**, and **operational runbooks** that ensure ALL-USE works flawlessly across all environments.

## BDT vs Development Phases: Key Differences

### Development Phases (WS1-WS6)
- **Focus**: Writing application code and features
- **Deliverables**: Source code files, components, and functionality
- **Mode**: Auto-pilot code generation
- **Output**: TypeScript/React/Python application code

### BDT Phases (BDT-P1 to BDT-P6)
- **Focus**: Operational automation and environment management
- **Deliverables**: Scripts, guides, procedures, and monitoring tools
- **Mode**: Infrastructure automation and operational procedures
- **Output**: Docker files, Kubernetes configs, automation scripts, runbooks
