# ALL-USE Agent: Refined Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document provides a detailed, phased implementation roadmap for the ALL-USE agent, aligned with the formalized protocol rules, decision trees, and success metrics. The roadmap is organized by workstreams and phases, with clear dependencies, milestones, and deliverables for each component.

## Implementation Approach

The ALL-USE agent will be implemented using an iterative, phased approach across six workstreams:

1. **Agent Foundation (WS1)**: Core architecture, memory systems, cognitive framework
2. **Protocol Engine (WS2)**: Week classification, trading protocols, decision systems
3. **Account Management (WS3)**: Three-tiered account structure, forking, reinvestment
4. **Market Integration (WS4)**: Market data, analysis, brokerage integration
5. **Learning System (WS5)**: Performance tracking, adaptation, improvement
6. **User Interface (WS6)**: Conversational interface, visualization, UX

Each workstream will progress through three phases:
- **Phase 1**: Core functionality and foundation
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced capabilities and integration
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features and optimization
