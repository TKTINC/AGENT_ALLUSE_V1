# ALL-USE Agent: Comprehensive Implementation Framework

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive framework for implementing the ALL-USE agent, detailing the core components, protocols, rules, and decision-making processes. It serves as the master reference for development, ensuring all aspects of the ALL-USE system are properly implemented according to specification.

## 1. Core Architecture

### 1.1 Agent Foundation

The ALL-USE agent follows a perception-cognition-action loop architecture:

1. **Perception**: Process inputs from users and market data
   - Natural language understanding for user queries and instructions
   - Market data interpretation for week classification and trade decisions
   - Account state monitoring for protocol application

2. **Cognition**: Apply ALL-USE protocol to make decisions
   - Protocol rule application based on market conditions
   - Account management decisions (setup, forking, merging)
   - Trade recommendation generation following delta rules

3. **Action**: Execute decisions and generate outputs
   - Natural language responses with protocol explanations
   - Trade recommendations with specific parameters
   - Account management operations and reporting

### 1.2 Memory Systems

The agent utilizes three primary memory systems:

1. **Conversation Memory**
   - Stores user-agent interaction history
   - Maintains context for ongoing conversations
   - Tracks user preferences and personalization

2. **Protocol State Memory**
   - Maintains current state of all accounts
   - Tracks week classifications and decision history
   - Records fork/merge events and reinvestment history

3. **User Preferences Memory**
   - Stores user risk tolerance and preferences
   - Maintains customization settings
   - Records notification preferences

## 2. Account Structure

### 2.1 Three-Tiered Account System

The ALL-USE system is built on a three-tiered account structure:

1. **Generation Account (Gen-Acc)**
   - **Purpose**: Weekly premium harvesting
   - **Initial Allocation**: 40% of total investment (with 5% cash buffer)
   - **Weekly Return Target**: 1.5% (least expected)
   - **Option Strategy**: 40-50 delta options
   - **Target Stocks**: Volatile stocks (e.g., TSLA, NVDA)
   - **Entry Protocol**: Thursday entry

2. **Revenue Account (Rev-Acc)**
   - **Purpose**: Stable income generation
   - **Initial Allocation**: 30% of total investment (with 5% cash buffer)
   - **Weekly Return Target**: 1.0% (least expected)
   - **Option Strategy**: 30-40 delta options
   - **Target Stocks**: Stable market leaders (e.g., AAPL, AMZN, MSFT)
   - **Entry Protocol**: Monday-Wednesday entry

3. **Compounding Account (Com-Acc)**
   - **Purpose**: Long-term geometric growth
   - **Initial Allocation**: 30% of total investment (with 5% cash buffer)
   - **Weekly Return Target**: 0.5% (least expected)
   - **Option Strategy**: 20-30 delta options
   - **Target Stocks**: Same stable market leaders
   - **Withdrawal Policy**: No withdrawals permitted

### 2.2 Cash Buffer Management

Each account maintains a 5% cash buffer for:
- Adjusting positions when necessary
- Taking advantage of unexpected opportunities
- Managing margin requirements
- Handling transaction costs

### 2.3 Account Initialization

The initialization process:
1. Calculate effective allocations after cash buffer
2. Set up initial account balances
3. Initialize tracking for each account
4. Prepare for first week classification

## 3. Protocol Engine

### 3.1 Week Classification

Market weeks are classified into three categories:

1. **Green Week**
   - **Characteristics**: Bullish trend, low volatility, strong support levels
   - **Indicators**: Major indices trending up, VIX below historical average, key stocks above support
   - **Protocol Response**: Standard protocol application, full position sizing

2. **Red Week**
   - **Characteristics**: Bearish trend, elevated volatility, broken support levels
   - **Indicators**: Major indices trending down, VIX above historical average, key stocks below support
   - **Protocol Response**: Conservative protocol application, reduced position sizing, earlier entries

3. **Chop Week**
   - **Characteristics**: Sideways trend, uncertain direction, mixed signals
   - **Indicators**: Major indices moving sideways, VIX fluctuating, key stocks at resistance/support
   - **Protocol Response**: Minimal new entries, focus on managing existing positions, very conservative approach

### 3.2 Trade Management Protocol

Trade management follows ATR-based rules for different scenarios:

1. **Entry Rules**
   - Gen-Acc: Thursday entry with 40-50 delta puts
   - Rev-Acc: Monday-Wednesday entry with 30-40 delta puts
   - Com-Acc: Following quarterly schedule with 20-30 delta puts

2. **Position Sizing**
   - Green Week: 10-15% of account per position for Gen-Acc, 5-10% for Rev-Acc
   - Red Week: 5-10% of account per position for Gen-Acc, 3-5% for Rev-Acc
   - Chop Week: No new entries for Gen-Acc, 3-5% for Rev-Acc with more conservative delta

3. **Adjustment Rules**
   - If underlying moves against position by 0.5-1.0 ATR: Monitor closely
   - If underlying moves against position by 1.0-1.5 ATR: Consider rolling to lower delta
   - If underlying moves against position by >1.5 ATR: Roll to lower delta or close position

4. **Exit Rules**
   - Take profit at 50-80% of maximum premium
   - Close positions by expiration day if not already closed
   - Roll positions if within profit target and expiration approaching

### 3.3 Reinvestment Protocol

Reinvestment follows a strict quarterly schedule:

1. **Gen-Acc Reinvestment**
   - Frequency: Variable based on forking threshold
   - Allocation: Reinvests as feasible based on forking requirements

2. **Rev-Acc Reinvestment**
   - Frequency: Quarterly
   - Allocation: 75% to contracts, 25% to LEAPS

3. **Com-Acc Reinvestment**
   - Frequency: Quarterly
   - Allocation: 75% to contracts, 25% to LEAPS

## 4. Account Management

### 4.1 Forking and Merging

The ALL-USE system implements a specific forking and merging mechanism:

1. **Forking Protocol**
   - **Trigger**: $50,000 surplus in Gen-Acc
   - **Split**: 50% remains in Gen-Acc, 50% creates new account
   - **New Account Allocation**: 50% to new Gen-Acc, 50% to Com-Acc
   - **Purpose**: Creates geometric rather than linear growth

2. **Merging Protocol**
   - **Trigger**: Forked account reaches $500,000
