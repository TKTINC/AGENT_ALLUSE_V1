# ALL-USE 10-Year Projection Summary (Conservative Model)

## Conservative Model Enhancements

1. **Significantly reduced high-return scenario multipliers**
   - C-WAP: Reduced from 1.5-2.0x to 1.0-1.3x target returns
   - C-WAP+: Reduced from 2.5-3.0x to 1.5-2.0x target returns
   - P-EW: Reduced from 1.0-1.2x to 0.8-1.0x target returns
   - All other scenarios similarly reduced

2. **Increased drawdown frequency**
   - 4 drawdown years out of 10 (Years 2, 4, 7, 9)
   - Account-specific drawdown impact:
     - Com-Acc: 0.4x (fully exposed)
     - Gen-Acc: 0.9x (minimal impact, 24-48hr exposure)
     - Rev-Acc: 0.8x (limited impact, 24-48hr exposure)

3. **Strict 60% success rate implementation**
   - Target: 60% of weeks achieve scenario-based returns
   - Actual: 57.3% of weeks achieved scenario-based returns (298 out of 520)
   - Non-success weeks limited to -0.2% to +0.2% returns (near break-even)

4. **Market correlation**
   - Drawdowns affect all accounts simultaneously (with account-specific impact factors)
   - Shared market conditions across all accounts
