# ALL-USE Agent: Functional Requirements and Narrative

## 1. Introduction: The ALL-USE Story

### 1.1 The Genesis

Sarah had been trading for five years. Like many retail traders, she had experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that came with the territory—elation during winning streaks, despair during drawdowns, and the constant anxiety of wondering if her next decision would be the right one.

One evening, after closing another position at a loss, she found herself searching for a better way. Not another technical indicator or trading strategy, but a fundamentally different approach to building wealth in the markets.

That's when she discovered the ALL-USE protocol.

"It's not about predicting market direction," explained the mentor who introduced her to the system. "It's about creating a mathematical edge through account architecture and protocol-driven decisions."

Skeptical but intrigued, Sarah began implementing the three-tiered account structure: a Generation Account (Gen-Acc) for weekly premium harvesting, a Revenue Account (Rev-Acc) for stable income generation, and a Compounding Account (Com-Acc) for long-term geometric growth.

Six months later, Sarah no longer worried about individual trades. The protocol made the decisions. The account structure managed the risk. And most importantly, her wealth was growing systematically, not through lucky guesses but through mathematical edge.

"I wish I had an assistant to help me implement this," she thought. "Someone who understands the protocol, can guide me through the decisions, and help me visualize my progress."

That's exactly what the ALL-USE agent is designed to be.

### 1.2 The Vision

The ALL-USE agent is not just another trading assistant. It's a comprehensive wealth-building companion that embodies the principles, protocols, and account architecture of the ALL-USE system.

Imagine having a methodical, emotionless partner who:

- Guides you through setting up your three-tiered account structure
- Helps classify each market week as Green, Red, or Chop
- Recommends protocol-based trading decisions for each account
- Tracks your performance across all accounts
- Tells you when it's time to fork a new account
- Visualizes your wealth-building journey
- Learns and adapts from experience
- Communicates with you through natural conversation

This is the ALL-USE agent—a system designed to remove emotion from trading decisions, implement a proven protocol, and build wealth geometrically rather than linearly.

## 2. The User Experience: A Day in the Life

### 2.1 Morning Protocol Check

**7:30 AM - Monday**

Alex sits down at his desk with his morning coffee and opens the ALL-USE agent interface on his tablet.

"Good morning, Alex," the agent greets in its calm, methodical tone. "It's Monday, and we have some protocol decisions to make for the week."

"Good morning," Alex replies. "What's on the agenda today?"

The agent displays a clean, organized dashboard showing Alex's three-tiered account structure: his Gen-Acc ($75,000), Rev-Acc ($60,000), and Com-Acc ($90,000). A notification indicates that his Gen-Acc is approaching the $50,000 surplus threshold for forking.

"Based on last week's performance and current market conditions, I've classified this as a Green week," the agent explains. "For your Rev-Acc, the protocol recommends selling puts at the 30-delta level on your watchlist stocks. Would you like to see the specific recommendations?"

"Yes, please show me," Alex responds.

The agent displays a list of recommended trades for the Rev-Acc, complete with strike prices, premium amounts, and expiration dates. Each recommendation includes a clear explanation of how it aligns with the protocol.

"For your Gen-Acc, since this is a Green week, the protocol recommends Thursday entry with 45-delta puts. I'll prepare those recommendations on Wednesday evening. Your Com-Acc doesn't require any action this week as we're following the quarterly reinvestment schedule."

Alex reviews the recommendations and asks, "What about the potential account fork? Are we ready for that?"

"Yes," the agent responds. "Your Gen-Acc will likely reach the $50,000 surplus threshold within the next two weeks. When that happens, the protocol recommends forking 50% to a new Gen-Acc and 50% to your Com-Acc. I've prepared a visualization of how this will affect your account structure."

The agent displays an animated diagram showing how the accounts will evolve after the fork, with projected growth paths for each account.

"That looks good," Alex says. "Let's proceed with the Rev-Acc trades today."

### 2.2 Mid-Week Adjustment

**2:15 PM - Wednesday**

Alex receives a notification on his phone from the ALL-USE agent.

"Alex, I've detected that XYZ stock has moved beyond the 1.5x ATR threshold in your Rev-Acc position. The protocol recommends an adjustment."

Alex opens the agent interface and sees a detailed analysis of the position, including the original entry, current price, and ATR calculation.

"What does the protocol recommend?" Alex asks.

"For this specific situation, the protocol recommends rolling the position down and out to collect additional premium and reduce risk. I've calculated the optimal roll based on current market conditions."

The agent displays the recommended adjustment with a clear visualization of how it will affect the position's risk profile and potential outcomes.

"I see," Alex says. "And how does this affect the overall account performance?"

"This adjustment maintains the account's income stability while reducing risk. Your Rev-Acc is still on track to meet its quarterly income target of $3,000."

Alex approves the adjustment and the agent prepares the order for execution.

"Also," the agent continues, "I've prepared the Gen-Acc recommendations for tomorrow's entry as promised. Would you like to review them now?"

"Yes, let's take a look."

The agent displays the recommended trades for the Gen-Acc, aligned with the Green week protocol for Thursday entry.

### 2.3 Weekend Review and Planning

**10:00 AM - Saturday**

Alex sits down for his weekly review session with the ALL-USE agent.

"Good morning, Alex. Ready for our weekly review?"

"Yes, let's see how we did this week."

The agent displays a comprehensive performance dashboard showing:

- Gen-Acc: $2,100 premium collected (4.2% weekly return)
- Rev-Acc: $950 premium collected (1.6% weekly return)
- Com-Acc: $1,800 growth from shares and LEAPS (2.0% weekly return)
- Overall system: $4,850 total growth (2.6% weekly return)

"Excellent performance this week," the agent notes. "Your Gen-Acc has now reached the forking threshold with a $52,000 surplus. Would you like to execute the fork now?"

"Yes, let's do it. Walk me through the process."

"According to the protocol, we'll split the $52,000 surplus with $26,000 going to a new Gen-Acc and $26,000 going to your Com-Acc. This will create your first forked account, Gen-Acc-2, while maintaining your original Gen-Acc-1."

The agent displays an animation showing the account structure transformation, with funds flowing from Gen-Acc-1 to both Gen-Acc-2 and Com-Acc.

"After this fork, your account structure will be:
- Gen-Acc-1: $75,000 (original)
- Gen-Acc-2: $26,000 (new fork)
- Rev-Acc: $60,000
- Com-Acc: $116,000 (after $26,000 addition)"

"That looks right," Alex confirms. "Let's execute the fork."

"Fork executed," the agent confirms after a moment. "I've updated your account structure and adjusted the protocols accordingly. Gen-Acc-2 will begin trading next week following the same protocol as Gen-Acc-1."

"What about next week's market outlook?" Alex asks.

"Based on current indicators, I'm seeing patterns consistent with a potential Chop week. I'll confirm the classification on Monday morning, but we should prepare for Chop week protocols, which would mean more conservative strikes and smaller position sizes."

The agent displays a preliminary analysis of market conditions and potential protocol adjustments for a Chop week.

"Thanks for the heads-up," Alex says. "Let's reconnect on Monday to finalize the plan."

The ALL-USE agent represents a paradigm shift in wealth-building through trading. By implementing the three-tiered account structure, protocol-driven decisions, and account forking mechanisms, it removes emotion from trading and creates a mathematical edge that compounds over time.

For users like Sarah and Alex, the ALL-USE agent isn't just a trading assistant—it's a wealth-building partner that guides them through the implementation of a system designed for geometric rather than linear growth.

The agent embodies the core principles of the ALL-USE protocol:

1. **Account Architecture Over Prediction**: Success comes from system design, not market prediction
2. **Protocol Over Emotion**: Decisions are made based on rules, not feelings
3. **Geometric Over Linear**: Wealth grows through compounding and forking, not linear accumulation
4. **Edge Over Luck**: Results come from mathematical edge, not fortunate timing

Through its methodical, confident, educational, calm, and precise personality, the ALL-USE agent helps users implement these principles consistently, leading to a wealth-building journey that transcends the typical trading experience.

This is the ALL-USE promise—a systematic path to wealth that works with the mathematics of the market rather than against it, guided by an intelligent agent that embodies the protocol in every interaction.
