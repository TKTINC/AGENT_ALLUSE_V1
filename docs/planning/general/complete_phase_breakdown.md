## **Dependencies and Sequencing**

### **Critical Path**
1. **WS1** â†’ **WS2** â†’ **WS3** (Core agent â†’ Protocol â†’ Accounts)
2. **WS4** can run parallel with **WS2-P2/P3** (Market data integration)
3. **WS5** depends on **WS2-P2** and **WS3-P2** (Learning needs protocol and account data)
4. **WS6** can run throughout, with major dependencies on **WS1-P3** and **WS2-P2**

### **Parallel Opportunities**
- **WS4-P1** can start after **WS2-P1** completion
- **WS6-P1** can start after **WS1-P3** completion
- **WS5-P1** can start after **WS2-P1** and **WS3-P1** completion

This structure provides clear milestones and allows for efficient tracking of progress across all workstreams!
