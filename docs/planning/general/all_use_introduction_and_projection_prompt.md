# ALL-USE Agent: Introduction and Projection Prompt

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to the ALL-USE investment system and a standardized prompt for requesting investment projections. It is designed to be used in new conversation threads where there is no prior knowledge of the ALL-USE system.

## Introduction to ALL-USE

### What is ALL-USE?

ALL-USE (Accelerated Leveraged Long-term Unified System for Earnings) is an innovative investment system designed to generate consistent income while building long-term wealth through a structured, protocol-driven approach to options trading. The system combines weekly premium harvesting with strategic reinvestment to create geometric rather than linear growth over time.

### Core Philosophy

ALL-USE is built on several key principles:

1. **Long-term investment horizon** that allows compounding to work its magic
2. **Focus on market-leading technology companies** with consistent growth and stability
3. **Balance between income generation and portfolio growth** for optimal returns
4. **Accelerated compounding** through consistent and strategic reinvestment
5. **Risk management through account diversification** rather than single-account scaling
6. **Protocol-driven decision making** that removes emotion from trading

### Three-Tiered Account Structure

The foundation of ALL-USE is its three-tiered account structure:

1. **Generation Account (Gen-Acc)**
   - **Purpose**: Weekly premium harvesting
   - **Initial Allocation**: 40% of total investment
   - **Strategy**: 40-50 delta options on volatile stocks (e.g., TSLA, NVDA)
   - **Weekly Return Target**: 1.5% (least expected)
   - **Entry Protocol**: Thursday entry for 1DTE (day till expiration) options

2. **Revenue Account (Rev-Acc)**
   - **Purpose**: Stable income generation
   - **Initial Allocation**: 30% of total investment
   - **Strategy**: 30-40 delta options on stable market leaders (e.g., AAPL, AMZN, MSFT)
   - **Weekly Return Target**: 1.0% (least expected)
   - **Entry Protocol**: Monday-Wednesday entry

3. **Compounding Account (Com-Acc)**
   - **Purpose**: Long-term geometric growth
   - **Initial Allocation**: 30% of total investment
   - **Strategy**: 20-30 delta options on same stable market leaders
   - **Weekly Return Target**: 0.5% (least expected)
   - **Withdrawal Policy**: No withdrawals permitted

### Key Protocol Elements

1. **Week Classification**
   - Each week is classified into one of 11 distinct types (e.g., P-EW, C-WAP, P-RO)
   - Classification determines trade management actions and expected returns
   - System adapts to different market conditions through this classification

2. **Account Forking**
   - When Gen-Acc accumulates a $50,000 surplus, it triggers a fork
   - 50% of surplus remains in Gen-Acc, 50% creates a new forked account
   - New forked account is split 50/50 between Gen-Acc and Com-Acc functions
   - Creates geometric rather than linear growth over time

3. **Account Merging**
   - When a forked account reaches $500,000, it merges into the parent Com-Acc
   - Consolidates growth into the compounding engine
   - Accelerates long-term wealth building

4. **Reinvestment Protocol**
   - Quarterly reinvestment schedule for Rev-Acc and Com-Acc
   - 75% allocated to contracts, 25% to LEAPS (Long-term Equity Anticipation Securities)
   - Gen-Acc reinvestment varies based on forking requirements

5. **Risk Management**
   - Position-level risk controls through delta management and position sizing
   - Account-level risk management through diversification and drawdown protection
   - System-level risk management through protocol adherence and adaptation

## Projection Prompt

### Request for ALL-USE Investment Projection

I'm interested in understanding the potential growth and income generation of the ALL-USE investment system over a 10-year period. Could you please provide a detailed projection based on the following parameters:

1. **Initial Investment**: $300,000
2. **Investment Horizon**: 10 years (2025-2035)
3. **Account Structure**:
   - Gen-Acc: $120,000 (40%)
   - Rev-Acc: $90,000 (30%)
   - Com-Acc: $90,000 (30%)

4. **Return Assumptions**:
   - Gen-Acc: 1.5% weekly return (least expected)
   - Rev-Acc: 1.0% weekly return (least expected)
   - Com-Acc: 0.5% weekly return (least expected)

5. **Protocol Parameters**:
   - Forking Threshold: $50,000 surplus in Gen-Acc
   - Merging Threshold: $500,000 in forked account
   - Reinvestment: Quarterly (75% contracts, 25% LEAPS) for Rev-Acc and Com-Acc

Please include the following in your projection:

1. **Year-by-Year Growth**: Total portfolio value at the end of each year
2. **Account Distribution**: How the investment is distributed across accounts over time
3. **Income Generation**: Potential weekly and annual income from the system
4. **Forking Events**: Number and timing of account forks over the 10-year period
5. **Merging Events**: Number and timing of account merges over the 10-year period
6. **Final Portfolio Structure**: Number of accounts and their values after 10 years
7. **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**: Overall portfolio CAGR for the 10-year period

I understand that these projections are based on the least expected weekly returns and that actual results may vary based on market conditions and protocol execution. Please provide both conservative and optimistic scenarios if possible.

## Notes on Projection Methodology

When responding to this prompt, please consider:

1. **Compounding Effects**: Account for weekly compounding within each account type
2. **Geometric Growth**: Factor in the impact of account forking and merging on overall growth
3. **Reinvestment Impact**: Calculate the effect of quarterly reinvestment on account growth
4. **Conservative Assumptions**: Use the stated "least expected" returns as baseline
5. **Realistic Limitations**: Consider practical limitations on scaling and execution
6. **Visualization**: Include tables or charts to illustrate the growth trajectory
7. **Explanation**: Provide clear explanations of the calculation methodology

## Disclaimer

The ALL-USE system involves options trading, which carries significant risk. The projected returns are based on historical performance and theoretical models, not guaranteed future results. The weekly return targets represent "least expected" returns based on the system's protocol and are not guaranteed. Actual results may vary significantly based on market conditions, execution quality, and other factors. This projection is for educational and planning purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.
