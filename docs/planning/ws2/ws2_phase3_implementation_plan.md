### Confidence-Based Automation Framework

#### Automation Levels
1. **Full Automation** (Confidence >90%): Execute automatically, notify human
2. **Supervised Automation** (Confidence 80-90%): Execute with human notification and 5-minute override window
3. **Human Approval Required** (Confidence 70-80%): Present recommendation, require approval
4. **Human Decision Required** (Confidence <70%): Present analysis, human makes decision

#### Trust Building Mechanism
- **Initial Phase**: All decisions require human approval
- **Learning Phase**: High confidence decisions automated after 50 successful trades
- **Mature Phase**: Graduated automation based on strategy performance history
- **Override Tracking**: Human override patterns used to improve AI recommendations

### Expected Return Calculation Methodology

#### Week Classification Return Analysis
Based on the weekly scenarios table and frequency distribution:

**Primary Profit Weeks (High Frequency):**
- **P-EW (Puts Expired Worthless)**: 31 weeks/year
  - Average weekly return: 2.5% (full premium collection)
  - Annual contribution: 31 Ã— 2.5% = 77.5%

- **C-WAP (Calls Worthless at Profit)**: 14 weeks/year
  - Average weekly return: 1.8% (call premium collection)
  - Annual contribution: 14 Ã— 1.8% = 25.2%

**Secondary Profit Weeks (Medium Frequency):**
- **P-AWL (Puts Away from Loss)**: 6 weeks/year
  - Average weekly return: 2.0% (put premium with profit)
  - Annual contribution: 6 Ã— 2.0% = 12.0%

- **C-WAP+ (Strong Call Appreciation)**: 6 weeks/year
  - Average weekly return: 3.0% (enhanced call profits)
  - Annual contribution: 6 Ã— 3.0% = 18.0%

**Other Profitable Weeks:**
- **C-PNO, C-RO, C-REC**: Combined 14 weeks/year
  - Average weekly return: 1.5% (various call strategies)
  - Annual contribution: 14 Ã— 1.5% = 21.0%

**Loss Mitigation Weeks:**
- **P-RO, P-AOL, P-DD**: Combined 8 weeks/year
  - Average weekly impact: -1.0% (managed losses through rolling)
  - Annual impact: 8 Ã— -1.0% = -8.0%

**Net Annual Calculation:**
- Total Positive Contribution: 77.5% + 25.2% + 12.0% + 18.0% + 21.0% = 153.7%
- Loss Mitigation Impact: -8.0%
- **Conservative Estimate**: 153.7% - 8.0% - 20% (safety margin) = **125.7%**
- **Optimistic Estimate**: 153.7% - 8.0% + 15% (optimization bonus) = **160.7%**

#### Key Assumptions
1. **Premium Collection Efficiency**: 85-95% of theoretical maximum
2. **Compounding Effect**: Weekly returns compound over 52 weeks
3. **Risk Management**: Effective loss limitation through rolling and recovery
4. **Market Conditions**: Normal market conditions with typical volatility
5. **Execution Quality**: Professional execution with minimal slippage
