## Functional Test Flows

### Test Scenario 1: Complete Agent Conversation Flow
- **Description**: Test the complete conversation flow from greeting through account setup to trade recommendations
- **Inputs**: Series of user messages: "Hello!", "Explain the ALL-USE protocol", "Setup accounts with $300,000", "What trades do you recommend?"
- **Expected Outputs**: Appropriate responses for each stage with context awareness and state management
- **Validation Steps**:
  1. Verify greeting response contains agent introduction
  2. Confirm protocol explanation includes all three account types
  3. Validate account setup creates proper account structure
  4. Check that trade recommendation request prompts for week classification
- **Success Criteria**: All responses are contextually appropriate and agent state is properly maintained

### Test Scenario 2: Enhanced Entity Extraction and Intent Detection
- **Description**: Test sophisticated entity extraction and intent detection with complex user inputs
- **Inputs**: Complex messages like "I want to setup accounts with $750,000 and focus on TSLA and NVDA with 40-50 delta options"
- **Expected Outputs**: Correct extraction of amount ($750,000), stock symbols (TSLA, NVDA), delta range (40-50), and intent (setup_accounts)
- **Validation Steps**:
  1. Verify monetary amount extraction with proper parsing
  2. Confirm stock symbol identification
  3. Validate delta range extraction
  4. Check intent classification accuracy
