# ALL-USE Agent: Workstreams and Phases

This document outlines the workstreams and phases for implementing the ALL-USE agent, a comprehensive wealth-building system that executes the ALL-USE protocol through an intelligent, conversational interface.

## Overview of Workstreams

The ALL-USE agent implementation is organized into six primary workstreams, each focusing on a critical aspect of the system:

1. **WS1: Agent Foundation** - Core architecture, memory systems, and cognitive framework
2. **WS2: Protocol Engine** - Week classification, trading protocols, and decision systems
3. **WS3: Account Management** - Three-tiered account structure, forking, and reinvestment logic
4. **WS4: Market Integration** - Market data processing, analysis, and brokerage integration
5. **WS5: Learning System** - Performance tracking, adaptation, and continuous improvement
6. **WS6: User Interface** - Conversational interface, visualization, and user experience

Each workstream progresses through three phases of implementation, with increasing sophistication and capability at each phase.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 0-3)

Phase 1 establishes the core functionality and basic implementation of each workstream:

- Basic capabilities in each workstream
- Functional but limited feature set
- Focus on establishing architectural foundations
- Manual processes where automation will come later
- Text-only interface with simple visualizations

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Months 3-6)

Phase 2 enhances the core capabilities with greater sophistication:

- Expanded capabilities in each workstream
- More automated processes and decision-making
- Enhanced visualization and interaction
- Introduction of speech interface
- Initial learning and adaptation capabilities

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Months 6-9)

Phase 3 introduces advanced intelligence and full automation:

- Fully automated processes across all workstreams
- Advanced learning and adaptation
- Sophisticated visualization and interaction
- Complete speech and text interfaces
- Optimized performance and user experience

## Dependencies and Implementation Order

The implementation follows these dependency principles:

1. **Foundation First**: WS1 (Agent Foundation) provides the core architecture for all other workstreams
2. **Phase-by-Phase**: Each phase is completed across all workstreams before moving to the next phase
3. **Critical Path**: Some workstreams have dependencies on others within each phase:
   - WS2 (Protocol Engine) depends on WS1 (Agent Foundation)
   - WS3 (Account Management) depends on WS2 (Protocol Engine)
   - WS5 (Learning System) depends on WS2, WS3, and WS4
   - WS6 (User Interface) integrates with all other workstreams
