# AGENT_ALLUSE_V1
# OFFICIAL V1 of ALL_USE AGENT IMPL

## Overview

The ALL-USE agent is an intelligent, conversational system that executes the ALL-USE wealth-building protocol. It features both text and speech interfaces with a simple yet informative UX that guides users through the implementation of the three-tiered account structure, protocol-driven decision making, and account forking mechanisms that define the ALL-USE system.

## Documentation

### Planning Documents

- **all_use_agent_frd_and_story.md**: Comprehensive functional requirements document with narrative elements that explain the ALL-USE agent through storytelling and technical specifications
- **workstreams_and_phases.md**: Defines the 6 workstreams and 3 phases for implementation
- **project_implementation_plan.md**: Detailed plan with deliverables, tasks, and timeline
- **ws1_phase1_implementation_prompt.md**: Comprehensive prompt for the first workstream
- **todo.md**: Checklist tracking all required tasks
- **implementation_status_and_next_steps.md**: Summary of current status and immediate next actions

## Implementation Approach

The ALL-USE agent will be implemented following these guiding principles:

1. **Iterative Development**: Each phase builds upon the previous, with increasing sophistication
2. **Modular Architecture**: Components are developed with clear interfaces for integration
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing at unit, integration, and system levels
4. **Documentation-First**: Detailed documentation precedes implementation
5. **User-Centered Design**: All features are designed with the user experience as a priority

## Workstreams

1. **WS1: Agent Foundation** - Core architecture, memory systems, and cognitive framework
2. **WS2: Protocol Engine** - Week classification, trading protocols, and decision systems
3. **WS3: Account Management** - Three-tiered account structure, forking, and reinvestment logic
4. **WS4: Market Integration** - Market data processing, analysis, and brokerage integration
5. **WS5: Learning System** - Performance tracking, adaptation, and continuous improvement
6. **WS6: User Interface** - Conversational interface, visualization, and user experience

## Getting Started

Refer to the planning documents in the `docs/planning` directory for detailed information on the implementation plan and requirements.

## Current Status

Initial planning and documentation phase is complete. Ready to begin implementation of WS1-P1 (Agent Foundation).
